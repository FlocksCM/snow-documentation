## Overview
sNow! is an open-source HPC suite which provides all the required elements to deploy, manage and customize a compute solution. With the sNow! default configuration, you will able to set up a completely functional HPC cluster from scratch in a very short time.

The predefined configuration contains advanced features which significantly reduce additional complexities for the end user. In addition to that, sNow! allows you to integrate simple hook scripts to customize your system to your needs.

We believe that HPC facilities will take advantage of this work and they will be able to deliver all this material to their end users after applying minor changes in the configuration and following steps in the documentation.

## Origins
sNow! is actively developed since 2008 by a team lead by [Jordi Blasco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordiblascopallares/), founder of [HPCNow!](http://www.hpcnow.com). The HPCNow! team has solid experience in the use, management and administration of supercomputers in scientific and engineering environments. The sNow! Suite comes directly from this experience and it is specifically designed to obtain the maximum performance of the cluster with each of the applications running on it. This makes it the best choice for the most demanding research centers.

The main goal of sNow! is to simplify routine yet complex operations in HPC administration as well as critical operations such as firmware and software updates, migrations, etc.
