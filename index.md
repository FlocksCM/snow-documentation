# Overview
sNow! is an open-source HPC suite which provides all the required elements to deploy, manage and customize a compute solution. With the sNow! default configuration, you will able to set up a completely functional HPC cluster from scratch in a very short time.

The predefined configuration contains advanced features which significantly reduce additional complexities for the end user. In addition to that, sNow! allows you to integrate simple hook scripts to customize your system to your needs.

We believe that HPC facilities will take advantage of this work and they will be able to deliver all this material to their end users after applying minor changes in the configuration and following steps in the documentation.
